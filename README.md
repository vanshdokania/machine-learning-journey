# Machine Learning & AI Journey – Vansh Dokania

This repository documents my journey into the world of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. It includes structured implementations, hands-on practice, and detailed notes based on leading educational resources such as Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning course, Sidhardhan’s YouTube tutorials, GeeksforGeeks, and other industry-standard materials. All projects and exercises are coded in Python using core libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn. The goal of this repository is to consolidate theory, coding, and applied ML skills into a single resource that reflects my progression toward becoming an AI/ML engineer.
